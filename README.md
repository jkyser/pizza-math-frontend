# Pizza Math

Welcome to Pizza math, a web application used to solve and graph math equations! While the 
application is not finished, I am currently working on adding more and more functionality
every day!

Check it out at the link below!!!

## Tech used in this project

**Front-end technologies**
- React.js
- Bootstrap 5
- Javascript

**Back-end Technologies**
- Java
- Spring Boot
- JUnit
- JFreeChart

**Other Tech used**
- Git
- GitHub (obviously)
- Heroku (deployment of back-end APIs)
- Netlify (deployment of front-end)

## Highlights of the project

This project is using a microservices approach with the form of communication being HTTP requests to
APIs. One microservice is the graphing microservice, and the other microservice is the equation solver.
The final refactor of the linear equation solving microservice implemented a Test-Driven Development approach
where unit tests were written before the code. The front-end was recently refactored with React and Bootstrap
to produce a better user experience, with the highlight of the project being the calculator!

## Future Improvements

- Implement more functionality into the equation solver (it only solves addition/subtraction based equations currently)
- Refactor the graphing microservice to use Django/Matplotlib/Python
- Refactor the microservices to communicate via RabbitMQ (or something similar) instead of HTTP requests
- Implement other math equation solving (quadratics, solve for x, calculus)

### Stretch goals for future improvement

- 3D graphing
- openGL implementation for cool graphing graphics
- Interactive lessons (very stretch goal)

I love math and this is something I will keep coming back to work on, so I want to eventually get to the point where
I implement these stretch goals! Thanks for looking at my project!
